          <h2 class="mt0"> Want to see what I was up to before 2013? You’ll have to hang out on my LinkedIn for that. I also enjoy running, skiing, and helping out on design with local non-profits like the Utah Avalanche Center. Once upon a time I worked for a letterpress shop. A few friends and I started a company named Join before we decided we didn’t want to start a company.  Ah, and I guess you can poke around my Instagram.</h2>
