          <p>Beyond my full-time positions, I have enjoyed volunteering my design and front-end development work to local organizations. Two of the non-profits that I've especially enjoyed working with are the Utah Avalanche Center and Hawkwatch International.</p>

      <p class="bold">Utah Avalanche Center</p>
      <p>For around 6 months in 2018 and 2019, I volunteered for the Utah Avalanche Center. As an avid backcountry skier, I use their product daily during the winter months, and having an opportunity to work on a complete redesign for the 2018/19 season has been a wonderful experience for me. You can see the site <a href="https://utahavalanchecenter.org/"> here</a> or a handful of screenshots below. I worked on all of the design and helped with a large portion of the front-end development for them.</p>
