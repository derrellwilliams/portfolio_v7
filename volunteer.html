          <p>Beyond my full-time work, I also enjoy volunteering my time doing design and front-end development work for local organizations. Two of the nonprofits that I've especially enjoyed working with are the Utah Avalanche Center and HawkWatch International.</p>

      <p class="bold">Utah Avalanche Center</p>
      <p>For around six months I volunteered for the Utah Avalanche Center. As an avid backcountry skier, I use their product daily during the winter months, and having an opportunity to work on a complete redesign for the 2018/19 season has been a wonderful experience for me. You can see the site <a href="https://utahavalanchecenter.org/"> here</a> or in the handful of screenshots below. I worked on all of the design and helped with a large portion of the front-end development for them.</p>

      <p>HawkWatch International is a leading raptor research organization that is focused on raptors as as indicator of ecosystem health. I've helped them with various types of marketing collateral, including fundraising proposals, calendars and invitations.</p>
